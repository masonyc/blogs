# Introduction

If two nodes both believe that they are the leader, that situation is called split brain, and it often leads to data loss

# Linearizability (Atomic consistency / Strong Consistency)

The basic idea is to make a system appear as if there were only one copy of the data, and all operations on it are atomic

In a linearizable system, as soon as one client successfully completes a write, all clients reading from the database must be able to see the value just written. Maintaining the illusion of a single copy of the data means guaranteeing that the value read is the most recent, up-to-date value, and doesn’t come from a stale cache or replica

# Linearizability Versus Serializability

Serializability is an isolation property of transactions, where every transaction may read and write multiple objects (rows, documents, records). It guarantees that transactions behave the same as if they had executed in some serial order (each transaction running to completion before the next transaction starts). It is okay for that serial order to be different from the order in which transactions were actually run

Linearizability is a recency guarantee on reads and writes of a register (an individual object). It doesn’t group operations together into transactions, so it does not prevent problems such as write skew, unless you take addtional measures such as materializing conflicts

A database may provide both serializability and linearizability, and this combination is known as strict serializability or strong one-copy serializability (strong-1SR). Implementations of serializability based on two-phase locking (see “Two-Phase Locking (2PL)”) or actual serial execution (see “Actual Serial Execution”) are typically linearizable

However, serializable snapshot isolation is not linearizable: by design, it makes reads from a consistent snapshot, to avoid lock contention between readers and writers. The whole point of a consistent snapshot is that it does not include writes that are more recent than the snapshot, and thus reads from the snapshot are not linearizable

# Relying on Linearizability

## Locking and leader election

A system that uses single-leader replication needs to ensure that there is indeed only one leader, not several (split brain). One way of electing a leader is to use a lock: every node that starts up tries to acquire the lock, and the one that succeeds becomes the leader. No matter how this lock is implemented, it must be linearizable: all nodes must agree which node owns the lock otherwise it is useless
